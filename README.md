 # 🚜 Hydraulic Cylinder Design Project

## 📌 Overview
This project presents a complete 3D design and motion simulation of a **double-acting hydraulic cylinder**. It is commonly used in industrial machinery such as scrap charging systems, presses, and lifting platforms.

The design includes all internal and external components, allowing for simulation of the cylinder’s linear movement and understanding of its function in real-world applications.
